### Â¡Hola! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ariel Mundo, I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. What once started as a mere curiosity to learn _R_ quickly transformed in awe and love for its capabilities to do Stats and great data visualization. I like to create meaningful data visualizations, and I like to tell good stories through data.
