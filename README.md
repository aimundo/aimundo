### Hola! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ariel Mundo, I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. What once started as a mere curiosity to learn R quickly transformed in awe and love. I like to create graphics that work for data visualization, and I am passionate about Statistics.
